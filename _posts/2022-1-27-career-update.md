## Don't Get Too Excited

I have no plans to leave C Spire, nor do I have plans to leave Jackson, MS. These are separate concerns to varied audiences but I wanted to nip that in the bud.

## Software Developer II

This is my current title. It has pretty good equity at other companies in addition to the fortunate fact that I enjoy being a developer at C Spire. I started at C Spire as a Software Developer I in December 2016. Three years ago I was promoted to Developer II. My entire tenure I've been full-time on a team called Customer Applications. We are primarily responsible for customer relationship management applications, both in-house and integrated into managed software services providers like Salesforce and ConnectWise.

Most of the time I'm writing Java code. We consume microservices, but we were also inspired by them and have created some of our own which have provided helpful data services to sales operations as well as inventory and asset management.

## Thank You

I've had the privilege of working with many talented developers and analysts across the years. I'd like to spend a moment to say thanks to everyone I can think of (please don't be mad if I haven't included you! I've had to do a lot of digging to be this grateful)

## C Spire - Past

Thomas Bell was the first to leave the team after I joined, which hit me a little harder than I expected. I was grateful for his influence. Many of my closest colleagues were from other parts of the department. Here are some of those who have left an impact on me and have moved on to other organizations: Tommy Naugle, PhD, one of my best friends; Carla Lewis who trusted me with C3; Connor Dougherty; Matt Winters; Nathan Frank; Brandon Stone; Logan Harrell; Austin Hille; Rijan Ghimire; Duk Lee; Matt Bolian; Tarris Walls; Logan Holleman; Rob Jones; Kimberly Sledge; Craig Sparks; Xavier Pittman; Cole Cochran; Meg Huntington; Jennie Brantley; Dan Chase; Chris Armon; John Best; Kayla Sween; Nikil Lokhande; Ashley Phillips; Thomas Grout; Brett Rogers; and Noah Toles who hired me.

## What's Next

In 2022, I am expecting good things. I believe in my team and I know that we can figure things out together. Since I've been a developer for 5 years, I'm interested in staying close to that world. As anyone might expect working at an enterprise corporation for some time it isn't always clear what responsibilities are _paid_ if you have a certain role. It is a necessary boundary to communicate, as at C Spire the next role for me is **System Analyst** continuing my work with CustApps and the SA position has had trouble with outside hires and contractors. The best SAs have come from the developers who are already familiar with the systems in place. I'm afraid there's a certain vocabulary that simply comes with time and it takes years of exposure to get the level of fluency some of our SAs have.

## Hustle

I am currently working remotely full-time but I try to visit the office at least once per week for our team meetings (thank God for this week's negative covid test) and some of the side-project work I have includes setting up my own home network. It's a lot like building a neighborhood: I have a gaming pc, an edge-compute kubernetes cluster, my work laptop, and a Pi I use for research.

Once a month I organize a big movie night with [JXN Film Club](jxnfilm.club). Check out the [Instagram](instagram.com/jxnfilmclub) and feel free to DM me on there (no guarantees it's actually me though, like 5 people have access to that account).

Finally, I'm working on some reporting automations for the church I attend called Foundry. There's no other software engineers there but the church uses Planning Center which has a REST API. I chose to use Go, which is a new language for me, but since there is no other software engineer there I have instructed the church to pray for more so I have someone to talk to about it.

## JXN

In conclusion, I want to say thank you to my family, especially my loving mother who has helped me get my home into shape.

I cannot wait to see what 2022 has in store!

## Valheim

[A brutal exploration and survival game from Iron Gate AB and published by Coffee Stain Publishing][storepage] for 1-10 players, set in a procedurally-generated purgatory inspired by viking culture. Battle, build, and conquer your way to a saga worthy of Odinâ€™s patronage!

The game was released Feb 2, 2021 and has received very positive reviews on Steam and in [C Spire Gaming][cspiregaming]'s [Discord server][csgdiscord].

Some college buddies and I first played on a world we'd been passing around via Google Drive. I was then volunteered to host the world on a dedicated server and I wanted to build a small system to check on the status of the server such that I could make it easy for my friends to know its uptime status.

In [version  1.14.0][1.14.0] of Uptime Kuma a new feature was introduced which enabled serving new status pages from an existing app instance. Utilizing this, I created [valheim.michaellamb.dev][valheim.michaellamb.dev] which is a status page for our dedicated server.

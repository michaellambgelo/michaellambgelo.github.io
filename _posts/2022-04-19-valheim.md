## Valheim

[A brutal exploration and survival game from Iron Gate AB and published by Coffee Stain Publishing][storepage] for 1-10 players, set in a procedurally-generated purgatory inspired by viking culture. Battle, build, and conquer your way to a saga worthy of Odinâ€™s patronage!

The game was released Feb 2, 2021 and has received very positive reviews on Steam and in [C Spire Gaming][cspiregaming]'s [Discord server][csgdiscord].

Some college buddies and I have been playing on a world we've been passing around via Google Drive. I've since been volunteered to host the world on a dedicated server and I wanted to build a small system to check on the status of the server.

In [version  1.14.0][1.14.0] of Uptime Kuma a new feature was introduced which enabled serving new status pages from an existing app instance. Utilizing this, I created [valheim.michaellamb.dev][valheim.michaellamb.dev] which is a new status page for our dedicated server.

I overengineered a solution by rigging up a new endpoint on [demo.michaellamb.dev](https://demo.michaellamb.dev/swagger-ui/) to parse through the Steam Web API's response. It's abstract enough that if you (random person reading this) wanted to use it, all you would have to do is find an address where you expect someone to be running a Valheim server and get a Steam Web API key and use the [Game Status Controller on the Swagger UI page](https://demo.michaellamb.dev/swagger-ui/#/game-status-controller/getValheimStatusUsingGET)

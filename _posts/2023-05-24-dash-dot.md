title : Featured Project - dash. - a glassmorphic dashboard
category: feature
---

dash. (or dashdot) is a modern server dashboard, running on the latest tech, designed with glassmorphism in mind. It is intended to be used for smaller VPS and private servers. Images are hosted on DockerHub, and are available for both AMD64 and ARM devices.

The image will require use of the `--privileged` option flag. This option gives the container privileged access to the host system, allowing it to perform potentially dangerous operations that are typically restricted.

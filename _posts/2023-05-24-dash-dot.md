dash. (or dashdot) is a modern server dashboard, running on the latest tech, designed with glassmorphism in mind. It is intended to be used for smaller VPS and private servers. Images are hosted on [DockerHub][dockerhub], and are available for both AMD64 and ARM devices.

The image will require use of the `--privileged` option flag. This option gives the container privileged access to the host system, allowing it to perform potentially dangerous operations that are typically restricted.

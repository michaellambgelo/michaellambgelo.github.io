At MagnoliaJS 2023, Chris DeMars posed the question: who is disabled?

In the context of his talk, it followed that his response was such: "Everyone."

Talking about the accessbility (a11y) of the Internet means creating an interet accessible to everyone.

Who has the possibility of being disabled, at some point in their life?

## Everyone

> In the realm of code and pixels, we unfold,
> A tale of "everyone," both young and old.
> In digital waves, a journey we start,
> Accessibility's essence, a work of art.
>
> For every user in the vast cyber sea,
> "Everyone" must navigate, swift and free.
> A symphony of code, a crafted blend,
> Where inclusivity is our guiding friend.
>
> Not just the agile, nor the keen of sight,
> But every soul, in the web's vast light.
> In lines of code, a chorus must swell,
> "Everyone" embraced, in each parallel.
>
> For those with vision, clear and bright,
> Or those who navigate the web at night,
> The door to information, open wide,
> "Everyone" should find it, side by side.
>
> In digital echoes, a chorus resounds,
> Through keyboard strokes, inclusion abounds.
> For those who hear and those who touch,
> A symphony of empathy, oh how much!
>
> To surf the web with ease and grace,
> "Everyone" must find their rightful space.
> No barriers strong, no walls so high,
> In the language of code, let empathy fly.
>
> Crafting lines of code, we weave,
> "Everyone" as the common motif.
> In alt text whispers, and ARIA's song,
> Inclusion's chorus, enduring and strong.
>
> For "everyone" transcends the word's mere rhyme,
> The heartbeat of a digital paradigm.
> Let progress rhyme in every line,
> Accessibility's eternal chime.

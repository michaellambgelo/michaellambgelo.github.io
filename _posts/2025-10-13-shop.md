## Something new is coming November 1st

I'm excited to announce that **shop.michaellamb.dev** will be launching on **November 1, 2025**! This new venture represents an exciting expansion of the michaellamb.dev ecosystem, bringing you custom merchandise and exclusive items powered by Fourthwall.

## What is Fourthwall?

[Fourthwall](https://fourthwall.com) is a creator-focused e-commerce platform that makes it easy to design, sell, and fulfill custom merchandise. It's trusted by content creators, streamers, and independent brands to handle everything from product creation to shipping logistics.

What I love about Fourthwall:

- **Print-on-demand** - No inventory management headaches
- **Global shipping** - Reach supporters worldwide
- **Quality products** - Premium materials and printing
- **Creator-friendly** - Built specifically for independent creators

### Custom Merchandise

The initial launch will feature:

- **Branded apparel** - Tie-dye T-shirt and a trucker hat
- **Office necessities** - Coffee mugs and notebooks
- **Special film selections** - used DVDs/Blu-rays/4KUHDs for sale

### Exclusive Designs

I'm working on original designs that reflect:

- The spirit of independent development
- Clean, minimalist aesthetics
- References to tech & culture
- Community-driven themes and inside jokes

## Why a shop?

This isn't just about selling stuff. The shop serves multiple purposes:

**Supporting the blog** - Revenue helps keep michaellamb.dev running and allows me to invest more time in creating quality content.

**Building community** - Merchandise creates a tangible way for readers to show support and connect with like-minded people, and gifting is highly encouraged.

**Creativity outlet** - Designing products is a fun creative challenge that complements the technical writing I do here, but it is also an outlet where I get to explore curation. I've already got some artists who I am considering comissioning for future collaborations.

**Learning opportunity** - Running an e-commerce operation teaches valuable lessons about business, marketing, and customer service.

## Launch timeline

- **October 13-31**: Final design work and product setup
- **November 1**: Official launch of shop.michaellamb.dev
- **November**: Initial product collection available
- **December and beyond**: Expanded catalog based on community feedback

## Another bit of news to look forward to...

"Let Your Light Shine: Music, Memory, and Magic" in Ryan Coogler's *Sinners* (2025)

### Coming October 16 – Sinners Day

What happens when a simple spiritual becomes a weapon against darkness?

In Ryan Coogler's *Sinners*, "This Little Light of Mine" isn't just a song—it's an act of defiance. Set in 1932 Mississippi, where Jim Crow's shadow looms as large as any vampire, Coogler weaves this beloved African American spiritual into a story about two brothers, a juke joint, and the sacred power of Black music.

From the Delta blues to hip-hop, from spirituals to supernatural horror, Sinners asks us to remember: Who gave us this music? What does it protect? And what are we willing to fight for when the monsters come knocking?

This Sinners Day, we're diving deep into how Coogler transforms a children's Sunday school song into something fierce, timeless, and necessary.
The light refuses to go out.

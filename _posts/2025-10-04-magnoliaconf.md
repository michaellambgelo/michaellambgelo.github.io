### My speaking topic

![michael lamb speaking at 2025 Magnolia Conf on the topic 'You Need a Static-site Blog'](/img/2025-10-04-magnoliaconf-speakercard.png)

My talk will center on my experience writing and maintaining this blog at [blog.michaellamb.dev](https://blog.michaellamb.dev). If I can convince someone to create a blog (with or without static-site technology) then I will consider this talk a success.

I'll be sharing my story on building my digital presence with a static-site generator to create a portable, maintainable hub for my personal brand and content. I'm not perfect at it, but maintaining a blog has taught me plenty and I'm looking forward to speaking about my insights.

If you're interested in modern web development, content strategy, or building your professional online presence, I'd love to see you there. The conference has an amazing lineup of speakers and sessions.

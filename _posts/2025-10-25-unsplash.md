## Unsplash Wallpapers

Unsplash is a web service that provides beautiful free images and photos with simple attribution requirements for usage. The [Unsplash Wallpapers app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unsplash-wallpapers/id1284863847) is a macOS app that allows users to set Unsplash photos as their desktop wallpaper, allowing users to enjoy a curated selection of high-quality photos on their Mac.

## Investigating storage contents

I've used this app on two MacBook devices and over a couple years it has built up a huge cache of images. After going through the steps to reclaim my storage space on my work-issued MacBook, I went through the steps again on my personal machine. I had absolutely no idea this was happening until I noticed storage on my work device was at 90% capacity. I installed [Disk Inventory X](https://www.derlien.com/) which displayed the contents of the disk in a treemap; the contents of my personal machine as shown in this screenshot.

Pointing the cursor around the mapped areas lets me see what files are clustered. The huge, dark blue rectangle is the folder where Unsplash Wallpapers downloads images, which can be seen in the GIF below. Each little box is an individual file.

Images clocked in at **22 MB** each. With over 13k files, there were **76 GB** on this machine.

On my work machine, the cache was **196 GB** â€” talk about bloat!

## Submitting a report to Unsplash

In addition to the Wallpapers app, Unsplash provides APIs to developers, so I dug around and tried to find an appropriate support channel assuming that it would be straightforward. The Unsplash support page is on Medium and there is no obvious place to report a bug, so the only meaningful way I felt I could communicate this issue was by reviewing the app in the App Store. I rarely review an app, but my hope is that someone who cares and is capable will see the review and report the issue. 

Perhaps this blog post might get the attention of the right person, but I am doubtful.

The Unsplash Wallpapers app is great for setting high quality desktop backgrounds, but until the app is fixed it will be at the cost of local storage.

## A workaround

Unfortunately, without a fix to the software itself the only real workaround is to set the app to only update the wallpaper manually.

With this configuration, I still get to enjoy beautiful wallpapers with the confidence that the app won't build up a huge cache over time.

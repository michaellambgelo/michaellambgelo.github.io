I am the organizer of the Jackson Area Web and App Developers community on Meetup and Discord. I am writing to share a survey I have created to better understand the needs of our community. I would be grateful if you could take a few minutes to complete it. 

If you've never visited my blog before, I hope you'll take a look around. I write about technology and my life. I also have a [GitHub](https://github.com/michaellambgelo) profile where I share my code and projects. This blog is hosted for free on GitHub Pages. 

I'd love to feature some of the projects from our community on the blog. If you have a project you'd like to share, please let me know. 

There's a section to include any freeform feedback, just share your blog, a little bit about yourself, and how I can reach you. I look forward to your contributions!

## Why is it important to survey the community? 

The survey will help me understand the needs of our community and make sure we are meeting the needs of our members. It will also help me make sure we are providing the best possible experience for our members. 

The survey is available on Microsoft Forms using the embed below. 

### All responses are anonymous.

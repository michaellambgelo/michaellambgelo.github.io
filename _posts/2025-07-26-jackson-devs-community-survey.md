I am the organizer of the Jackson Area Web and App Developers community on Meetup and Discord. I am writing to share a survey I have created to better understand the needs of our community. I would be grateful if you could take a few minutes to complete it. 

## Why is important to survey the community? 

The survey will help us understand the needs of our community and make sure we are meeting the needs of our members. It will also help us make sure we are providing the best possible experience for our members. 

The survey is available on Microsoft Forms using the embed below. 

### All responses are anonymous.

## But How Do You Know It's a Waste?

The problem with not wasting your life is that someone has to decide what counts as waste. Usually that someone is standing at a podium, or writing a book, or running a corporation, or—let's be honest—benefiting somehow from your anxiety about whether you're doing enough.

Waste implies a correct use. A television left on in an empty room. Electricity running through pixels no one sees. But a life? What's the correct use of a life? 

The question itself is flawed because it sneaks in a values system through the back door and pretends it was there all along, natural as breathing. But there's nothing natural about the idea that your life has a *purpose* that you might *miss*. That's a story we tell, not a truth we discover.

## The Algebra of Enough

I wasted four hours yesterday. At least, that's what I'd have to call it if I believed in waste. I watched two films back-to-back: *The Battle of Algiers* (1966) directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, a searing documentary-style chronicle of colonial violence and revolutionary resistance, and *The Wind Will Carry Us* (1999), a slow Iranian meditation on life and death and the art of paying attention from director Abbas Kiarostami. Four hours I could have spent—what? Answering emails? Building something? Contributing?

But here's what actually happened: I watched people fight for their freedom and die for it. I watched other people drink tea and wait for an old woman to die so they could film her funeral. I watched Pontecorvo's handheld urgency and Kiarostami's patient stillness. I watched war and peace, not in sequence, but as adjacent possibilities of human existence. I sat with the contrast until something in me shifted, some small recalibration of what matters.

Was that waste?

Only if you've already decided what my life is *for*.

## The Convenience of Purpose

There's a certain type of religious messaging—let's not name names, but you know the one—that wraps ancient wisdom in the language of productivity. Don't waste your life on pleasure, on rest, on art that doesn't evangelize, on work that doesn't explicitly serve the mission. The mission, conveniently, looks a lot like showing up, signing up, giving up your time and money and energy to institutions that survive on your fear of insignificance.

I'm not anti-Christian. I'm anti-convenient. I'm suspicious when the path to eternal meaning happens to align perfectly with the needs of the contemporary American church, or the logic of late capitalism, or whatever power structure is currently selling you a solution to the problem of your own existence.

When Jesus told people to leave their nets and follow him, he was asking them to abandon security, not find a better optimization strategy. When he praised Mary for sitting at his feet instead of helping Martha with dinner, he wasn't endorsing a productivity hack. He was saying: sometimes the correct use of time is to stop using it.

## The Tyranny of Potential

We've been taught to see ourselves as investments. Human capital. Potential energy that must be converted to kinetic or it's wasted. Every moment becomes a referendum: Am I maximizing this? Could I be doing more?

But an investment in what? Returns for whom?

The watchlist sits on my phone like a second job. Films I should see, books I should read, languages I should learn, skills I should acquire. The tyranny isn't in wanting to grow—it's in the "should," the constant evaluation against some imagined ideal use of my finite hours.

And yet: I will die having seen only a fraction of the films ever made. I will die having read only a sliver of what's been written. I will die with potential unrealized, languages unlearned, places unvisited, perfect versions of myself that never materialized.

Unless waste isn't about what you failed to do. Perhaps waste is measuring yourself against these phantom obligations in the first place.

## Enjoyed Hours Are Not Lost Hours

Here's the whimsical truth: life isn't so serious that it can be wasted as long as it was *enjoyed*. Not enjoyed in the sense of pure pleasure, but in the sense of being *present* for it, of letting it mean something on its own terms rather than as currency toward some other goal.

I enjoyed those four hours. Not in a mindless way—I was paying attention, feeling things, thinking. But I enjoyed them in the sense that I was *there*, fully, not calculating their value or comparing them to what else I might have done.

*The Battle of Algiers* showed me the cost of freedom. *The Wind Will Carry Us* showed me the art of waiting. Neither made me more productive. Neither advanced my career or my eternal soul's résumé. But I am different for having seen them, in small ways I couldn't articulate at a performance review or explain at heaven's gate.

In Kiarostami's film, an engineer drives into a remote village, ostensibly for work, but really he's waiting. Waiting for an old woman to die so he can film the funeral rituals. He drives his SUV up winding roads, gets terrible cell reception unless he's on a hilltop, drinks milk in a cellar from a woman he never sees, and talks to a gravedigger who recites poetry while working. Nothing happens, and everything happens. The film is about being there, about the texture of presence, about what you notice when you're not rushing toward the next thing.

If that's waste, then waste is sacred.

## The Metrics We Inherit

We don't invent the fear of wasting our lives. We inherit it. It's passed down through sermons and self-help books and the ambient anxiety of a culture that can't sit still. We absorb it young: the sense that life is a test with a right answer, that there's a rubric somewhere, that someone's keeping score.

But what if there's no score? What if the only waste is spending your life trying to prove you didn't waste it?

The people most worried about wasting their lives are rarely the ones enjoying them. They're too busy auditing themselves, running the numbers, checking if this moment counts. They've outsourced the question of meaning to frameworks that promise certainty: Do this, believe this, live this way, and your life will have mattered.

But meaning doesn't work like that. You can't arrive at it by following someone else's map. You have to risk the pathless places, the unproductive hours, the detours that lead nowhere but turned out to be somewhere after all.

## What Actually Matters

In *The Wind Will Carry Us*, there's a conversation that happens in fragments, the engineer talking with the local doctor about life and death and what we're promised versus what we have:

**Engineer:** Old age is a terrible illness.  
**Doctor:** Yes, but there are worse illnesses. Death...  
**Engineer:** Death?  
**Doctor:** Yes. When you close your eyes on this world, this beauty, the wonders of nature and the generosity of God, it means you'll never be coming back.  
**Engineer:** They say that the other world is more beautiful.  
**Doctor:** But... who has come back from there to tell us if it's beautiful or not?

Then the doctor quotes poetry, the kind that cuts through centuries:

*"They tell me she is as beautiful as a houri from heaven!"*  
*"Yet I say that the juice of the vine is better."*  
*"Prefer the present to these fine promises."*  
*"Even a drum sounds melodious from afar..."*  
*"Prefer the present..."*

This is the conversation that haunts me. Not because it's anti-religious—it's not, really. But because it refuses to let the promise of elsewhere justify absence here. The other world might be more beautiful. Fine. But you're in this one. The light is on these hills. The woman is singing in this cellar. The turtle is on its back on this road.

### Prefer the present.

I think what actually matters is harder to measure and easier to miss. It's the quality of your attention. The integrity of your presence. Whether you loved the people in front of you. Whether you were curious about the world. Whether you let yourself be changed by beauty, or sorrow, or two films that had nothing to do with your goals.

It's not about what you produced or achieved or built. It's about whether you were *alive* while you were living, or whether you spent your whole life preparing for some future vindication that never comes because you were too busy preparing to actually arrive.

The wind will carry us, eventually. All of us. The question isn't whether we used our time correctly. The question is whether we were there for it—the battle, the waiting, the tea, the silence, the film that moved us for reasons we can't quite explain.

That's not waste.

That's life.

And life, by definition, cannot waste itself. It can only be lived or not lived. Enjoyed or not enjoyed. Present or absent.

The rest is just someone else's story about what you should have done instead.

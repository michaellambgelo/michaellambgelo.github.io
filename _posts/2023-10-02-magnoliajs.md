MagnoliaJS is the premier web development conference hosted in the capitol city of Mississippi at the Mississippi Museum of Art downtown. With all the stories of Mississippi as a failing state, it is important to recognize MagnoliaJS as an opportunity for people in the web industry to learn about the state from its storied museums. The art museum in particular is an excellent community center and venue for this conference, as well as being rich with catering options from close by!

## 1. Why do I want to attend MagnoliaJS

I won't lie: the food is a big draw. There's great food in Jackson and MagnoliaJS is a great chance for it to be showcased in front of a national (sometimes global) audience.

Another, more personal reason is that the conference organizers are friends of mine who I want to support. The conference is also quite emphatic about accessibility and inclusion as themes and as a policy, so everything from the registration process to attendance is demonstrative of these values. MagnoliaJS will begin on Tuesday, October 17, with a talk on accessibility and neurodiversity from [Homer Gaines][homergaines]. I'm also looking forward to a live coding session from [Karl Groves][karlgroves] demonstrating accessibilty principles in JavaScript.

## 2. What do I expect to learn

My primary goal is to listen and learn about the varied perspectives in the web industry. While there will be some JavaScript covered at the conference, there are a number of other topics that may shed light on a different way of thinking, so I am approaching with an open mind.

## 3. How will this benefit my personal growth

I am always willing to take the time to listen to story tellers in Mississippi spaces. I come away from these types of interactions inspired and motivated, and this usually takes a direct impact through the leadership decisions I make.

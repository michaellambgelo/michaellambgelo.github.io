In the spring of 2007, I stood among the Missouri All-State Choir under the baton of conductor Elena Sharkova, preparing to perform Moses Hogan's arrangement of "This Little Light of Mine." What distinguished Sharkova's approach was her willingness to break convention. Rather than select a single soloist to carry the piece, she divided the solo sections among four different voices, each blending beautifully with the next. This collaborative vision transformed what could have been a showcase into a communion, a reminder that the light we carry is both singular and collective. At seventeen, I didn't fully understand the weight of what we were singing, only that something in those rising harmonies felt ancient and persevering, like a secret message passed hand to hand across generations.

Nearly two decades later, sitting in a darkened theater watching Ryan Coogler's *Sinners*, I heard those opening notes again — not Hogan's arrangement, but the song itself, resurfacing in a film that would provide a mythological tale told by a modern voice. And in that moment, I understood what Sharkova had been teaching us all along: that "This Little Light of Mine" is a song about choosing to be the light that you are in a world inviting you into the darkness.

## The Architecture of Light: Moses Hogan's Gift

To understand the spiritual architecture of *Sinners*, we must first understand Moses Hogan — a man who spent his brief, luminous life excavating the sacred from the soil of African American musical tradition. Born in New Orleans on March 13, 1957, Hogan was a prodigy who guided his uncle Edwin's choir with hand gestures before he could read music, and by age six was accompanying church choirs on piano. His formal training took him from the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts to Oberlin Conservatory, with subsequent studies at Juilliard and Louisiana State University. In 1977, he won first place in the Kosciuszko Foundation's Chopin Competition, establishing himself as a formidable classical pianist.

But Hogan's true calling lay elsewhere. Rather than pursuing a career in the concert halls of Europe, he returned to New Orleans and devoted himself to arranging spirituals — those coded songs of resistance born in the belly of American slavery. Over his lifetime, he published 88 arrangements for voice, each one a kind of archeological restoration. He set out to honor the traditional essence of these songs while giving them what one critic called "a new voice for spirituals in America." His work on "Ezekiel Saw de Wheel" is perhaps his most celebrated arrangement, reimagining a spiritual whose central image—the wheel within a wheel—resonated deeply with enslaved Africans as a Christian interpretation of the Kongo cosmogram, a symbol of cyclical time and spiritual continuity. I had the privilege of singing this arrangement at another special choir event in high school.

When Hogan died in 2003 at the age of 45, he left behind a body of work that continues to be performed by high school, college, church, and professional choirs worldwide. His arrangements are now the lingua franca of American choral music, so ubiquitous that many singers don't realize they're singing Hogan when they sing spirituals a cappella.

His arrangement of "This Little Light of Mine" is a masterclass in restraint and revelation. The piece begins with a quiet but warm intoned melody; the entire choir serves as a backdrop for the solo performance in the piece. The soloist stands and gives testimony to the light that he will shine, and the dynamics of the choir behind him rise and fall as he reaches the climax of each line of verse. But then comes the transformation. The second half crescendos into rich, massive chords that seem to contain multitudes, as if that single light has multiplied into a constellation. The harmonies don't just support the melody; they surround it, protect it, insist upon it. The final chords ring out, resplendent and full of confidence, like a declaration of war against any force that would seek to dim it.

When our choir performed this piece under Sharkova's direction, I felt that transformation viscerally. The four soloists she chose didn't just take turns; they passed the light between them, each voice adding its own timbre and testimony before the full choir caught fire. It was inclusive in the way that spirituals have always been inclusive—not by erasing difference, but by weaving it into a larger tapestry of survival.

## Opening the Veil: SINNERS and the Sacred

Ryan Coogler's *Sinners* opens with a narration that could have been written about Hogan himself: "There are legends of people born with the gift of making music so true it can pierce the veil between life and death, conjuring spirits from the past and the future." The film's opening montage traces a lineage of musical storytellers: West African griots, Irish fili, Choctaw firekeepers. This is Coogler positioning music not as entertainment but as a form of spiritual technology, a way of maintaining connection across time and death.

And there, woven into the opening sequence, is "This Little Light of Mine," a song I had sung eighteen years earlier without fully understanding its power. In *Sinners*, the spiritual becomes both prologue and epilogue, bookending one story that is really three stories, each a different way of understanding what it means to keep your light burning in a world designed to extinguish it.

## Three Movies, Three Theologies

What makes *Sinners* such a daring work of cinema is that it refuses to be just one thing. Instead, Coogler has crafted at least three films that occupy the same mythological space, each one commenting on and complicating the others.

**The first film is a Southern gothic crime drama**, a tale as old as the Delta itself. Smoke and Stack Moore are twin brothers who flee Mississippi for Chicago, hoping to escape the suffocating racism of Jim Crow only to discover that prejudice wears different masks in different cities. Disillusioned, they return home with a plan: they've robbed the Irish and Italian mobs up north, and now they're going to use that money to build something of their own: Club Juke, a safe space for Black folks to gather, dance, and breathe freely for a few hours. This is the story of Black entrepreneurship under impossible conditions, of men trying to carve out sovereignty in a land that has never granted them citizenship in anything but name.

This first film is grounded in historical reality. The Great Migration, which saw over six million Black Americans leave the South between 1916 and 1970, was driven by the dual forces of economic opportunity and survival. The hope was escape from lynching, from voter suppression, from the daily violence of white supremacy. But as the Moore brothers discover, the North was no promised land. Racism simply put on a different uniform, traded the rope for the redline, the lynch mob for the police raid. Their return to Clarksdale, Mississippi, to establish Club Juke is an act of defiant homecoming, a refusal to keep running.

**The second film is a love letter to blues music**, and it's here that *Sinners* transcends plot to become pure diegetic expression. The Moore brothers recruit their cousin Sammie, played with soulful intensity by Miles Caton, to be part of the house band at Club Juke. Sammie is rarely seen without his guitar, a 1932 Dobro Cyclops resonator that Stack claims once belonged to Charley Patton, the "father of the Delta Blues" (though we later learn the guitar actually belonged to their father, a lie that reveals how desperately Stack wants to connect Sammie to a lineage of greatness).

The emotional apex of this second film arrives during a surreal musical sequence that collapses time itself. Sammie performs "I Lied to You," an original song for the film, when suddenly the boundaries between eras dissolve. A character named Delta Slim delivers a speech that could serve as the film's thesis: "Blues wasn't forced on us like that religion. Nah, son, we brought this with us from home. It's magic, what we do. It's sacred, and big." As he speaks, Club Juke transforms into a temporal crossroads. An electric guitarist in '70s rock regalia appears, shredding beside a DJ in '80s hip-hop gear. B-boys break dance among the 1930s club-goers. A West African griot materializes with a drum. The film is showing us what Hogan knew instinctively: that Black music is not a linear progression but a spiral, each generation reaching back to pull forward, each style containing echoes of what came before and prophecies of what's to come.

This is the film that lives inside Coogler's chest, the one that wants to argue that blues music is not just entertainment or even art. It's a form of ancestral communication, a way of maintaining connection to home even when home has been stolen from you.

**The third film is a vampire story**, and it arrives like a thunderclap forty minutes into the 140-minute runtime, shocking audiences who thought they knew what kind of movie they were watching. A trio of pale-skinned musicians looking like they wandered out of an Appalachian hollow arrives at Club Juke, asking to perform. They're denied entry, and what follows is a night of horror that transforms the club into a charnel house.

But this is not a generic vampire film. Coogler has built his own American mythology, one that codes vampirism as cultural appropriation and colonization. These bloodsuckers don't just drain bodies, they drain culture, hollow out tradition, and wear it like a costume. They perform "Pick Poor Robin Clean," a traditional blues song, but their version feels predatory and parasitic. After being denied entry to Club Juke, they retreat and perform "Wild Mountain Thyme," a Scottish/Irish folk standard that became popular during the American folk revival of the 1960s — a movement in which white artists often profited from Black musical traditions without acknowledgment or compensation.

The film's most audacious move is its brief introduction of Choctaw vampire hunters. They play figures who appear for a single scene but carry immense thematic weight. In the opening montage, Coogler draws a parallel between West African griots, Irish fili, and Choctaw firekeepers, suggesting a global network of peoples who understand that music and storytelling are not luxuries but necessities, forms of knowledge that must be protected. By positioning the Choctaw as vampire hunters, Coogler is acknowledging another genocide, another story of land theft and cultural appropriation. The vampires in *Sinners* are not just bloodsuckers; they're colonizers, and they've been doing this for centuries.

The visual language of this third film draws on both horror and history. When the vampires lay siege to Club Juke, they're backed by an army of converted victims, growing exponentially with each kill. It's an invasion that mirrors the historical violence of white mobs attacking Black communities: the Tulsa Race Massacre, the Rosewood Massacre, countless other acts of racial terrorism in which white Americans literally burned Black prosperity to the ground. In one particularly chilling scene, the vampires perform "Rocky Road to Dublin," an Irish folk song, during a massive fight sequence. I think this piece serves as a reminder that these monsters carry their own histories of colonization and diaspora, but that trauma does not excuse them from perpetuating it upon others.

## Three Endings, Three Lights

Here is where Coogler's vision becomes truly radical: *Sinners* doesn't just contain three films — it also contains three endings, each one offering a different theological answer to the question the movie has been asking all along: How do you keep your light burning when the world wants to devour you?

**The first ending belongs to Smoke**, and it arrives in the film's climactic moments. After a night of unspeakable violence, after watching his brother Stack get bitten and turned, Smoke makes an impossible choice. He stays behind to fight, to protect what's left of his community, to hold the line even though he knows it will cost him everything. This is the ending for those who believe in martyrdom, in the idea that sometimes the light must burn so bright that it immolates the person carrying it. It's tragic and heroic in equal measure, and it leaves us hollow.

**The second ending belongs to Stack**, and it arrives in the mid-credits scene. We jump forward sixty years to October 16, 1992, to a blues club in Chicago. An elderly Sammie—played by blues legend Buddy Guy in a piece of casting that makes the soul sing—has just finished a performance. He's lived the life he always wanted, a traveling musician who never stopped playing. But then Stack walks in, still young, still vampiric, accompanied by Mary (his vampire lover from the chaos at Club Juke). They've come to hear Sammie play, to reconnect with the cousin they lost decades ago.

This scene is heartbreaking in its tenderness. Stack has lost his humanity but not his memory. He's been cursed to walk forever, but he uses that curse to follow the music, to stay connected to the family he destroyed. He cannot die, cannot age, cannot escape what he's become—but he also cannot forget who he was. It's an ending that asks: What if the light doesn't go out, but transforms into something cold and eternal? What if survival itself becomes a kind of damnation?

**The third ending belongs to Sammie**, and it arrives in the post-credits scene as the film's true revelation. We cut back in time to young Sammie, back in the church, holding the guitar the twins gave him. He's alone, and he begins to play a bluesy rendition of "This Little Light of Mine." His version is raw, unpolished, and absolutely beautiful. It is a spiritual rendered as blues, sacred music secularized, secular music made sacred, church and juke joint meeting in a single moment. When he finishes, he looks up with an expression that contains multitudes: grief, determination, joy, defiance.

This is the ending that Coogler himself has called the key to the entire film. In interviews, he's spoken about breaking down in tears when he realized what the movie was actually about: not Smoke's heroism or Stack's tragedy, but Sammie's choice. Sammie is the one who survives without becoming a monster. He's the one who takes the trauma of that night and transforms it into music, who honors the dead by continuing to play, by keeping the light alive not through violence or vampirism but through art.

The film's original post-credits scene featured Sammie's preacher father, a nod to the tension between sacred and secular that runs through Black musical history. But Coogler wisely revised it, giving us instead just Sammie and his guitar, just the music and the choice. Because that's what "This Little Light of Mine" has always been about. Letting a little light shine is not a command from God but a decision each person must make: Will you let them blow it out? Or will you keep singing?

## The Light That Refuses

When I performed Moses Hogan's arrangement of "This Little Light of Mine" in 2007, I was singing about perseverance in the abstract, about some vague spiritual fortitude. I didn't yet understand that the song was born in a specific historical moment, that it was weaponized during the Civil Rights Movement, that when activists sang "Hide it under a bushel? NO! I'm gonna let it shine," they were responding to very real threats of violence, of being told to stay quiet, to not make trouble, to accept their subjugation.

Ryan Coogler understands this history bone-deep. *Sinners* is his meditation on the cost of resistance, the price of keeping your light burning in a world full of vampires—literal and metaphorical. The film's tripartite structure is a way of showing us that there is no single story of survival, no single answer to the question of how we endure.

Smoke's ending says: Sometimes you burn out fighting.
Stack's ending says: Sometimes you become the thing you fought against.
Sammie's ending says: Sometimes you transform the trauma into art and keep moving.

And it's Sammie's ending that contains the film's deepest truth, the one that connects most powerfully to the spiritual tradition from which the film draws its title and its soul. When Sammie plays that bluesy version of "This Little Light of Mine" in the post-credits scene, he's doing what Black musicians have done for centuries: taking the imposed religion of the colonizer and making it their own, taking the spirituals born in slavery and transforming them into blues, taking the blues and transforming them into jazz, into rock, into hip-hop, into something that cannot be contained or controlled.

He's also making a choice that neither of the twins could make. Smoke chose martyrdom. Stack chose survival at any cost. But Sammie chooses something more difficult: to live with the memory, to carry the grief, to keep playing anyway. His light doesn't burn bright enough to destroy him, and it doesn't turn cold and vampiric. It simply keeps shining, note by note, year after year, as long as an old man in a Chicago blues club can still make people feel something true.

This is the ultimate thesis of *Sinners*: that the real victory is not in the spectacular heroism or even in the long undeath of memory, but in the quiet insistence on making beauty despite everything. The film's mythology — griots and firekeepers and vampire hunters — all point to the same truth: that culture is a form of resistance, that music is a way of fighting back, that every time we sing a spiritual or play the blues or pass a story to the next generation, we are refusing to be extinguished.

## The Light We Carry Forward

On October 16, Sinners Day, the date that appears in the film's post-credits scene, we might ask ourselves which ending we're living. Are we burning out in our fights against injustice? Are we becoming the monsters we oppose? Or are we finding ways to transform our grief into art, our trauma into testimony, our individual lights into a collective blaze?

When Elena Sharkova chose to divide the solo sections of "This Little Light of Mine" among four singers in 2007, she was teaching us something essential: the light is not a solo. It's a choir. It's a community. It's passed hand to hand, voice to voice, generation to generation. Moses Hogan knew this when he arranged the song to begin with a soloist and end with massive, protective harmonies. Ryan Coogler knows this when he makes Sammie—not the heroic twins, but the quiet cousin with the guitar—the true protagonist of *Sinners*.

And I know this now, nearly twenty years after standing in that choir, understanding at last what we were really singing about. We were singing about the refusal to be made invisible. We were singing about the decision to keep going even when the darkness has teeth. We were singing about the bluesy, beautiful, defiant choice to let our lights shine—not because it's easy, not because we'll be rewarded, but because we cannot do otherwise.

This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine.

Even and especially when the vampires come knocking.

## *Sinners* is now available to stream on HBO Max and is available to rent on VOD.

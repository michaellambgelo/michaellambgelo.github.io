## One time, at summer camp...

One of my favorite memories from Bible college was at Taylor County Camp in Georgia, an 8-day long experience. There was a building we used for gathering in groups for games, Bible studies, and to hang out and chat. The building had great air conditioning and was really just a big room. The windows could be blacked out with coverings so even at the height of noon, it could be pitch black.

I don't remember if there was anyone else, but there were two brothers, the Paynes. Both were wickedly talented musically, and we also had compatible musical tastes. I loved learning about their favorite artists and discovering new music, but this memory centers on something we all knew and thus experienced together.

All three of us were fans of the band **Thrice**, so we decided to spend our penultimate afternoon in this darkened room, listening to the entirety of *The Alchemy Index*. 

If you've never listened to it, *The Alchemy Index* is a series of four EPs: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air, with recordings spanning from 2006 to 2008.

There is a six-track pattern followed on each EP, with the final song written as a sonnet. It's 95 minutes to listen to all four EPs, and I highly recommend turning everything off and just going on a journey. You might be surprised by the depth of storytelling and the richness offered in the varying musical techniques that stretch the band's rock style.

*The Alchemy Index* represents a pivotal moment in Thrice's evolution, coming after the experimental *Vheissu* (2005) and serving as a bridge to their later works. Where previous albums like *The Illusion of Safety* and *The Artist in the Ambulance* established their post-hardcore credentials, this collection showed a band willing to completely deconstruct their sound in service of a larger artistic vision.

## Fire (The Alchemy Index Vols. I & II)

The journey begins with **Fire**, an explosive and aggressive EP that showcases Thrice at their heaviest. This collection captures the destructive and purifying nature of flame through crushing riffs and intense vocals. The opening track "Firebreather" immediately sets the tone with its driving rhythm and Dustin Kensrue's powerful delivery, while "The Messenger" builds tension with its apocalyptic imagery.

What makes Fire particularly compelling is how it balances brutality with melody—a skill honed through albums like *The Artist in the Ambulance*. Where earlier tracks like "All That's Left" or "Stare at the Sun" delivered straightforward aggression, Fire's "Backdraft" demonstrates the band's evolved ability to create atmospheric tension within heavy frameworks. "The Arsonist" tells a haunting story of destruction and consequence that echoes the narrative depth of *Vheissu*'s "Red Sky," but with elemental focus. The EP culminates with "A Song for Milly Michaelson," a sonnet that serves as both a love letter and a meditation on passion's consuming nature—a thematic complexity that would later resurface in different forms across *Beggars* and *Major/Minor*.

## Water (The Alchemy Index Vols. I & II)

**Water** represents a complete tonal shift, embracing fluidity and introspection in ways that would later influence albums like *Beggars* and *To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere*. This EP flows like its namesake element, with ambient textures and ethereal melodies that wash over the listener. "Digital Sea" opens with electronic elements that feel both modern and timeless—a stark contrast to the analog warmth of earlier tracks like "The Weight" from *The Illusion of Safety*, yet pointing toward the digital themes that would appear in later works like "The Grey."

"Open Water" creates vast sonic landscapes that mirror the ocean's expanse, employing space and silence in ways rarely heard since *Vheissu*'s more experimental moments. The standout track "Lost Continent" showcases the band's experimental side, incorporating unconventional song structures and atmospheric production that makes the structured aggression of *Identity Crisis* feel like a distant memory. "Night Diving" feels like a descent into the depths, both musically and emotionally, while the sonnet "The Water" closes the EP with gentle acoustic guitar and poetic reflection—a gentleness that would become more prominent in their post-hiatus work.

## Earth (The Alchemy Index Vols. III & IV)

**Earth** grounds the listener with organic, rootsy sounds that feel connected to the soil—a dramatic departure from the electronic textures of earlier experiments like "The Red Death" from *Vheissu*. This EP embraces folk influences and acoustic instrumentation, creating some of the most intimate moments in Thrice's catalog and presaging the stripped-down approach they would later explore on *Beggars*.

"Moving Mountains" opens with a gentle, contemplative melody that builds into something more substantial, much like geological processes themselves—a patience rarely afforded in the urgency of albums like *The Artist in the Ambulance*. "Digging My Own Grave" explores themes of mortality and legacy with haunting harmonies that echo the introspective moments of *Vheissu* but with newfound vulnerability. "The Earth Isn't Humming" presents a more urgent environmental message wrapped in beautiful melodies, while "Child of Dust" serves as a meditation on humanity's relationship with the natural world—themes that would later resurface in the ecological consciousness of *To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere*. The closing sonnet "The Earth" brings the EP full circle with its reflection on our temporary place in the eternal cycle of nature.

## Air (The Alchemy Index Vols. III & IV)

**Air** lifts the entire experience skyward with the most experimental and atmospheric sounds of the collection—pushing even further into uncharted territory than *Vheissu*'s most adventurous moments. This EP embraces space and breath, using silence as effectively as sound in ways that would later influence the contemplative passages of *Major/Minor* and the ambient interludes of *To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere*.

"Broken Lungs" opens with delicate piano and builds into something transcendent, a far cry from the immediate impact of early singles like "T&C" or "Under a Killing Moon." "The Sky Is Falling" creates tension through minimalist arrangements that make the dense production of *The Artist in the Ambulance* seem almost overwhelming in retrospect. "A Song for Milly Michaelson" returns in a completely reimagined form, showing how the same story can be told through different elemental lenses—a concept that would later inform the varied approaches across their entire discography. "Silver Wings" soars with ethereal vocals and ambient textures that feel weightless, while the final sonnet "The Air" serves as both conclusion and invitation, leaving the listener suspended in contemplation much like the open-ended questions that would later define *Palms*.

## The Memory Lives On

Sitting in that darkened room at Taylor County Camp, we didn't just listen to music—we experienced a complete artistic statement that represented everything Thrice had been building toward since *Identity Crisis*. *The Alchemy Index* took us through every emotional register, from the crushing weight of Fire (which felt like a culmination of their heaviest impulses) to the weightless beauty of Air (which pointed toward the experimental territory they would continue exploring in *Palms* and beyond). The Payne brothers and I shared something profound that afternoon, a musical journey that demonstrated how art can transform a simple moment into something transcendent.

Years later, whenever I hear any track from *The Alchemy Index*, I'm transported back to that room, feeling the cool air conditioning against the Georgia heat outside, surrounded by friends who understood that sometimes the best way to spend an afternoon is to surrender completely to the power of music. What makes this memory even more special is knowing how this collection served as both a summation of Thrice's first decade and a blueprint for everything that followed—from the folk influences that would define *Beggars* to the electronic textures that would shape *Major/Minor* and beyond. It remains one of my most cherished memories—not just of the music itself, but of the communion that great art can create between people.

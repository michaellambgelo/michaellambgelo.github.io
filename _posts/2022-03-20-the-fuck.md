## Featured Projects

This is my first __Featured Project__ post. Once a week I want to highlight an interesting software project I find. This week's is one which has been hilarious to read up on this morning over coffee at Urban Foxes: *The Fuck*.

## the fuck

From the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck):

> *The Fuck* is a magnificent app, inspired by a [@liamosaur](https://twitter.com/liamosaur/)

[tweet](https://twitter.com/liamosaur/status/506975850596536320),
that corrects errors in previous console commands.

The most eye-catching and hilarious part of the project's README is the example gif, clearly demonstrating what I find so funny about this project.

I installed *The Fuck* using Homebrew on Mac OS.

## meme update

I don't have enough outlets for sharing memes, and especially spicy memes like this one (sent to me by [Matthew Lewis](https://twitter.com/_mattycakes)) need a special memorialization.

## welcome to my blog

My name is Michael Lamb. I'm a software engineer currently living in Jackson, Mississippi and I like to write, so that's why this blog exists.

If you want to get to know me better, here's a few things about my life:

1. I founded [JXN Film Club](jxnfilm.club)  and am co-host on [JXN Film Club The Podcast](https://anchor.fm/jxnfilmclub) because I love movies. Check out my [Letterboxd stats](https://letterboxd.com/michaellamb/stats/).
2. I work full-time in software and application development for [C Spire](https://cspire.com) across all 3 lines of business.
3. I have 2 cats, Willow and Monte.

I have deployed this blog for free using Github Pages. The source code for this blog is kept on my GitHub and the repository README has more details about the technologies used to build [michaellamb.dev](https://michaellamb.dev).

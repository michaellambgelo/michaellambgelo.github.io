Hello, world!

My name is Michael Lamb. I'm a software engineer currently living in Jackson, Missisippi and I like to write, so that's why this blog exists.

If you want to get to know me better, here's a few things about my life:

1. I founded [JXN Film Club](jxnfilm.club)  and am co-host on [JXN Film Club The Podcast](https://anchor.fm/jxnfilmclub) because I love movies. Check out my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/michaellamb/).
2. I work full-time in software and application development for [C Spire](https://cspire.com) across all 3 lines of business.
3. I have 2 cats, Willow and Monte.

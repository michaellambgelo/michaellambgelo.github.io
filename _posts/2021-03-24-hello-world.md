## welcome to my blog

My name is Michael Lamb. I'm a software engineer currently living in Jackson, Mississippi, and I like to write so that's why this blog exists.

If you want to get to know me better here are a few things about my life:

1. I founded [JXN Film Club](jxnfilm.club)  and am co-host on [JXN Film Club The Podcast](https://anchor.fm/jxnfilmclub) because I love movies. Check out my [Letterboxd stats](https://letterboxd.com/michaellamb/stats/). Follow the film club on Instagram [@jxnfilmclub](https://www.instagram.com/jxnfilmclub/) and [join us on Discord](https://discord.jxnfilm.club). Come chat movies!
2. I work full-time in software and application development for [C Spire](https://cspire.com) across all 3 lines of business. I'm also an officer in the [C Spire Gaming Club](https://cspiregaming.com) and own the [C Spire Gaming Discord](https://discord.cspiregaming.com) server. Come chat games!
3. I have 2 cats, Willow and Monte. No Discord servers for them.

I deployed this blog for free using Github Pages. The source code for this blog is kept on my GitHub and the repository README has more details about the technologies used to build [michaellamb.dev](https://michaellamb.dev).

I plan to use this blog to write technical content related to work I do on my home lab cluster. As a software engineer my primary skills involve reading and writing code and I would like a local development environment with which I can execute some personal projects.

Here are some things I'd like to focus on:

- Container orhcestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- App containerization
- Go (golang)
- Spring Boot

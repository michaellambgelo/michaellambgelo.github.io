## Now Announcing GitHub Discussions

GitHub features a Discussions pane on code repositories so that communities can share thoughts and feedback without having to open a new issue.

This post is to announce that I want YOU to leave a comment on my announcement post over on GitHub. My blog is more informative than interactive (and I like it that way) but GitHub as a tool for organizing community around code is right up my alley. I hope you'll join me and we can connect.

## Leave a comment on my announcement post

And when you're done, check out the repo! I've enabled Discussion on my [Spring Boot Demo app][demo] and there's simply no reason you shouldn't pull the code, try it out yourself, and then come back to the Discussions pane to tell me what you learned.

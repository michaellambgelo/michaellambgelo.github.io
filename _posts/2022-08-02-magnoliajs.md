## MagnoliaJS Conference 2022

The MagnoliaJS Conference was first founded by J.C. Hiatt in 2019. Since then, the conference has connected over 450 members on Discord alone! Web development and software engineering go hand in hand, so naturally I'm interested in a lot of the topics that are discussed at MagnoliaJS events. I plan on taking part in this exciting conference and I'm hopeful that you might find it interesting too! I've collected all the details I personally would care about here (I'm being selfish because I will be referencing this during the event myself and I'm just writing it ahead of time).

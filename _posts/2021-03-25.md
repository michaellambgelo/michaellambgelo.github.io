## Welcome to my newly refabricated weblog! 

I've hosted various blogs across different platforms. Way back in the day I played around with Geocities and Xanga. Then there were the blessed days of Posterous. Most recently I hosted a blog using Ghost. In this latest foray, I'll be running one attached to my Github profile using Github:Pages and attempting to focus on more technical subjects.

## What I'm working on right now

I want to use this blog to document a new sandbox project to explore **cluster computing** concepts. 

# To Build a Computer Cluster

A _computer cluster_ is a set of computers working together and viewed as a single system. The individual computers that make up a cluster are called _nodes_.

Here's what I've purchased so far:

# Goals
- Set up and network a compute cluster with 6 nodes
- Learn to install, configure, deploy, and maintain containers using Kubernetes
- Learn to write Ansible Playbooks (exploring infrastructure automation)

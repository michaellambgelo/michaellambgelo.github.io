## Social Cards

Without using SEO tags to serve metadata for social media, links will appear plainly and without much to draw the eye. I wanted to change how my blog post presents on social media, so I searched for how to add SEO tags to my existing blog. Since my blog is built on GitHub Pages and thus uses Jekyll, I was able to install the `jekyll-seo-tag` plugin. Here's how.

## Install jekyll-seo-tag

In the `Gemfile` of the Jekyll project add the following line:

```Gemfile
gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'
```

In the `_config.yml` of the project, find the `plugins_dir` section and add the following line:

```yml
- jekyll-seo-tag
```

## Add SEO frontmatter

My blog is a fork of [gh-pages-blog](https://github.com/thedereck/gh-pages-blog). `jekyll-seo-tag` requires frontmatter to be added to two files, located in the `_includes/head` directory. I simply added the following frontmatter expression in the `<head>` tags of `page.html` (which represents the parent blog) and `post.html` (which represents any individual post):

```
{ % seo % }
```

I added spaces on either side of the frontmatter (the braces and percent symbol) to avoid Jekyll from replacing it with the SEO data it generates during the build process of the blog.

After this change, I am now able to add an `image` property to any post to specify a social card. For any post without a value for `image` will use a default social card, which is also the card used for the parent blog.

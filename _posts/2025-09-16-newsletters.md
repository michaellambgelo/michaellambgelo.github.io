## Where do we go when the algorithm fails us?

Since the old days of simple government sites, message boards, webrings and Flash games, the Internet has certainly transformed a lot.

I've heard the joke that 20 years ago, "Facebook was all farmland."

Is it a city now? 

I don't think it's a city I want to live in long-term, I know that much. 

So, I will be spending time without social media apps on my phone.

## Inventory

All social links listed on [michaellamb.dev](https://michaellamb.dev) are currently present on my phone, except for the Facebook app and LinkedIn because I'm crazy but not insane. All social apps will be removed from my phone and I will only access them via desktop occasionally. 

- Discord
- Threads
- Instagram
- Bluesky (including third-party clients)
- YouTube

There is only one exception I am making to social media apps on my mobile device: **Letterboxd**. If you know me, you might have just rolled your eyes.

## My reduction is targeting consumption

I am guilty of spending 30-45 minutes per day on Instagram alone. Threads is about the same. Discord is the worst. 

I use all these social media platforms on desktop, and will continue to do so in the ways that feel normal to me.

It is much easier for me to focus on tasks at a desktop than it is on my mobile phone, and I find myself scrolling at all times of the day. 

Mobile social media apps will be removed from all of my mobile devices this week. I have decided to go without social apps for no specified period of time, but it will likely be a long while before I won't feel like I'm setting myself up for failure. 

## Newsletters from michaellamb.dev

In an effort to stay connected with friends, family, and community, I'd be honored and delighted if you would subscribe to this blog as a newsletter. An email newsletter is distributed at 9 AM (CT) the day after a new post is published. This delivery schedule is subject to change â€” especially if you give me feedback on what you prefer!

This idea was inspired by my friend and colleague, [**Jeana Smith**](https://www.instagram.com/jeanachos/)

## Additional updates

I've recently migrated the taxonomy of all blog posts on the site. 

Categories are now simpler and more focused on the type of content I want to create. You can find categories in the navbar and the sidebar (the sidebar is below the content and author bio on mobile).

Tags are much more expanded and are featured only on the sidebar.

Signing off now, I hope you have a great day!

### Thanks for reading

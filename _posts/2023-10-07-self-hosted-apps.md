## FUTURE TALK

At C Spire, there is a monthly series known as FUTURE TALK which features presentations from various sectors of the company engaged in research topics. One particular area of my expertise is self-hosted applications, as I've been able to successfully stand up many such instances for myself and others. Maintenance is typically pretty simple, but there is a lifecycle to self-hosted apps.

## Lifecycle of Self-hosted Apps

Below is a brief outline on the lifecycle of installing and maintaining a self-hosted application. It is always important to begin with why: why am I using this project? What problem is it helping me solve? Generally, my hope is that this blog is helpful to people who are curious about self-hosting applications and who may want some guidance on how to figure it all out.

## 1. Research and Selection

### 1.1 Description

In this initial phase, the consumer identifies a need for a specific application or service. They research various self-hosted solutions available in the market or open-source community to meet their requirements. This stage involves evaluating features, compatibility, and community support.

### 1.2 Outcome

Selection of the most suitable self-hosted application for their needs.

## 2. Installation and Configuration

### 2.1 Description

Once the consumer has chosen an application, they proceed to install and configure it on their chosen server or hosting environment. This step involves setting up the necessary dependencies, database, and any required configurations.

### 2.2 Outcome

A working instance of the self-hosted application is set up and accessible.

## 3. Customization and Integration

### 3.1 Description

Consumers may customize the self-hosted application to align with their specific requirements. This can include creating user accounts, configuring settings, and integrating the application with other tools or services.

## 3.2 Outcome

A tailored instance of the self-hosted application that meets the consumer's unique needs.

## 4. Regular Usage

### 4.1 Description

Consumers use the self-hosted application for its intended purpose. This involves day-to-day interaction with the application, such as creating content, managing users, and performing routine tasks.

### 4.2 Outcome

Continual utilization of the self-hosted application to fulfill its intended function.

## 5. Monitoring and Maintenance

### 5.1 Description

Regular monitoring of the self-hosted application is essential to ensure it remains operational and secure. Maintenance tasks include applying updates, patches, and security fixes, as well as troubleshooting and resolving issues.

## 5.2 Outcome

A well-maintained and secure instance of the self-hosted application.

## 6. Scaling and Performance Optimization (Optional)

### 6.1 Description

As the application's user base or workload grows, consumers may need to scale their infrastructure to accommodate increased demand. This involves optimizing performance, adding additional resources, and ensuring the application can handle higher traffic.

### 6.2 Outcome

A scalable and high-performance self-hosted application.

## 7. Backup and Disaster Recovery

### 7.1 Description

Consumers should implement a robust backup and disaster recovery strategy to protect their data and ensure minimal downtime in case of unforeseen events.

### 7.2 Outcome

Data backups and a recovery plan in place to safeguard against data loss or system failures.

## 8. Regular Updates and Upgrades

### 8.1 Description

Staying up to date with the latest releases of the self-hosted application is crucial for security and feature enhancements. Consumers should regularly update and upgrade their installations.

### 8.2 Outcome

An up-to-date and feature-rich self-hosted application.

## 9. Evaluation and Retirement (Optional)

### 9.1 Description

Over time, consumer needs may change, or better alternatives may become available. Consumers should periodically assess the relevance and performance of the self-hosted application. If necessary, they can retire the application and select a new one.

### 9.2 Outcome

A well-informed decision regarding whether to continue using, replace, or retire the self-hosted application.

## Repeat Steps 1-9 (as needed)

### Description

The consumer may go through this lifecycle again if they have additional self-hosted applications or if they decide to replace or upgrade their existing ones.

### Outcome

A well-managed portfolio of self-hosted applications tailored to the consumer's evolving needs.

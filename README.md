### A note from Michael

You'll find posts about a variety of topics at michaellamb.dev.
I'm interested in exploring distributed systems both to educate myself and others.
When this blog project started, I built and documented a Pi cluster as the initial posts.
Most content has been generated by this new environment. Some is more community or professional oriented.
A little bit of personality is sprinkled in.

I want my blog to be accessible, but still have some of my fingerprints on it.

If anything in my blog inspires you, I'd love to know about it.

## Documentation

- [Maintenance Guide](MAINTENANCE.md) - Track site issues, improvements, and progress
- [Post Template](_templates/post.md) - Template for creating new blog posts

## SEO Images

Each post should have an associated SEO image in the `/seo` directory. The image filename should match the post date (e.g., `2025-01-09.png`).

To verify SEO images for all posts:

```bash

# Run the verification script

ruby scripts/verify_seo_images.rb

# The script will:

# 1. Check if all posts have an SEO image specified in front matter

# 2. Verify that the specified images exist

# 3. Check for the default fallback image (default.png)

# 4. Report any missing or invalid images

```

## Git Hooks

This repository includes Git hooks to automate certain checks:

1. Install the hooks:

```bash

# Make the install script executable

chmod +x scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Run the install script

./scripts/install-hooks.sh

```

1. Pre-push hook:

   - Automatically runs SEO image verification before each push
   - Prevents pushing if any SEO images are missing
   - Can be bypassed in emergencies with `git push --no-verify`

1. Pre-commit hook:

   - Runs markdownlint on staged markdown files
   - Ensures consistent markdown formatting
   - Prevents commits if linting fails
   - Can be bypassed with `git commit --no-verify`
